# ManthanHateContentVICTOREM
This is the repository containing hate content prediction python code.
We have downloaded the dataset from kaggle website .
We have utilised support vector machine classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier, XGBclassifier, and used voting classifier on the previously said classification algorithms to obtain more accurate results.
We have used pytesseract library to extract text from image and used speech_recognition library to convert audio to text.
The audio from video is extracted from moviepy library and that audio is then converted to text with speech recognition library.
Our solution provides 88% accuracy.
